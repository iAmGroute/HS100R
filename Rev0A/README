# HS100R Rev0A

Status: Finished (Archived)

## Known issues:

  - The pins of the pressure sensor (DPS310) are in the wrong order, so the sensor should not be mounted.
    [Datasheet, page 5](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-DPS310-DS-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462576f34750157750826c42242)
    (Note: the numbering is confusing, it starts from top right instead of top left)

  - The RF module's performance needs to be tested after being soldered on the pcb, and later placed in the case.
    It is possible that the FR4 below the antenna interferes.

  - It is not possible to fit the SD card without modifications to the case.
